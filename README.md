This project is done as a part of Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp. I experimented several components which were not required by the original challenge: 

* In this project, I gave more attention to responsive web design: I added different user experience for the mobile and tablet version. (I made the notification alert visible on mobile and tablet, I also changed the structure of the mobile portrait version)

* I also wanted to implement a working tab. I used Javascript to move between the tabs and show/hide the contents accordingly.

* I experimented with linear-gradient and skew, box-shadow and text-shadow on tab contents.

* I used several pseudo-classes; including :not().

* I also experimented with the blinking text on mobile portrait version (using CSS animation). I commented it out after learning that it's not advisible regarding acccessibility.

## The problems I couldn't solve (yet): 

In landscape, the last notification action isn't proper. The second issue is: when I switch between "Suggestions" and "Find designers" in portrait mode I have a glitch which I couldn't find how to fix. (and not sure why it's happening, but I have a feeling it's related to "tab panels" since the styling of the both tab contents are identical.)
