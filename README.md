This project is done as a part of Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp. I experimented several components which were not required by the challenge. In this project, I gave more attention to
responsive web design: I added different user experience for the mobile and tablet version. (I made the notification alert visible on mobile and tablet, I also changed the structure
of the mobile portrait version)

I also wanted to implement a working tab (which isn't the case with the original challenge). I used Javascript to move between the tabs and show/hide the contents accordingly.

I experimented with linear-gradient and skew, box-shadow and text-shadow on tab contents.

I used several pseudo-classes; including :not().

I also experimented with the blinking text on mobile portrait version (using CSS animation). I commented it out after learning that it's not advisible regarding acccessibility.

The problems I couldn't solve (yet): 

/* In landscape,the last notification action isn't proper. The second issue is: when I click suggestions and find designers in portrait I have a glitch which I couldn't find how to fix */
